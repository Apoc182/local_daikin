# Local Daikin Integration
This is a full integration for Daikin air conditioners using local network access. It includes UI-based setup and supports climate control, switches, selects, and sensors.
Built quick and dirty as a bridge until we have a better solution available, this custom integration allows you to connect Daikin air conditioners, specifically those running firmware version 2.8.0, to Home Assistant. It serves as a temporary solution to ensure compatibility until the official Home Assistant team can address the issue.

## ðŸ”§ Installation

1. Copy the `local_daikin` folder into your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory:
   ```
   <config>/custom_components/local_daikin/
   ```

2. Restart Home Assistant.

3. Go to:
   **Settings â†’ Devices & Services â†’ Add Integration â†’ Local Daikin**

4. Enter the IP address of your Daikin air conditioner.

## Features

- Full climate control (temperature, HVAC mode, fan, swing)
- Extra entities:
  - Switches: Power, Quiet Fan, Swing Mode
  - Select: HVAC Mode Fan Speed, Swing Mode

  - Sensors: Outdoor temperature, energy today, runtime today indoor temp, humidity
  - Sensor: Target temperature (Not programming only, not in UI, Null if not applicable due to HVAC Mode)

## Notes

- Ensure your Daikin unit is on the same network as Home Assistant.
- Communicates with the `/dsiot/multireq` endpoint on your device.
